Depreciated Code that is no longer updated or worked on based upon Improving the Littlefield Simulation
LeanFactory.Management

Created by Lukasz Bakun, Sean McCulloch, and Kyle McCulloch
Python simulation code is available for usage upon contacting Lukasz at LukaszBakunLB@gmail.com
Code created in a 7 month timespan as an Applied Computing Capstone, fully online due to the coronavirus, between three colleagues at different universities.
This was mainly designed as an alternative to the Littlefield Simulation that our operations management classes used in our Universities, as the Littlefield Simulation costed students/school roughly $75-$80 per student.
Creating a less expensive, updated, alternative seemed like a great idea to support not only our local communities but ourselves.

Attached is a Database Schema to show how you would design the MySQL database in order to make a simulation work using this front end


Uses Node.js and Vue for front end, interfacing with a MySQL database.
Also uses Python for the backend and simulation that interfaces with the MySQL database.

The front end code is open source software, and is allowed to be used by anybody.
